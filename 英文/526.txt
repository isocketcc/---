¡¡¡¡Stannis studied her, unsmiling. ¡°The Iron Throne is mine by rights. All those who deny that are my foes.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°The whole of the realm denies it, brother,¡± said Renly. ¡°Old men deny it with their death rattle, and unborn children deny it in their mothers¡¯wombs. They deny it in Dorne and they deny it on the Wall. No one wants you for their king. Sorry.¡± 
¡¡¡¡Stannis clenched his jaw, his face taut. ¡°I swore I would never treat with you while you wore your traitor¡¯s crown. Would that I had kept to that vow.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°This is folly,¡± Catelyn said sharply. ¡°Lord Tywin sits at Harrenhal with twenty thousand swords. The remnants of the Kingslayer¡¯s army have regrouped at the Golden Tooth, another Lannister host gathers beneath the shadow of Casterly Rock, and Cersei and her son hold King¡¯s Landing and your precious Iron Throne. You each name yourself king, yet the kingdom bleeds, and no one lifts a sword to defend it but my son.¡± 
¡¡¡¡Renly shrugged. ¡°Your son has won a few battles. I shall win the war. The Lannisters can wait my pleasure.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°If you have proposals to make, make them,¡± Stannis said brusquely, ¡°or I will be gone.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Very well,¡± said Renly. ¡°I propose that you dismount, bend your knee, and swear me your allegiance.¡± 
¡¡¡¡Stannis choked back rage. ¡°That you shall never have.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°You served Robert, why not me?¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Robert was my elder brother. You are the younger.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Younger, bolder, and far more comely . . .¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°. . . and a thief and a usurper besides.¡± 
¡¡¡¡Renly shrugged. ¡°The Targaryens called Robert usurper. He seemed to be able to bear the shame. So shall I.¡± 
¡¡¡¡This will not do. ¡°Listen to yourselves! If you were sons of mine, I would bang your heads together and lock you in a bedchamber until you remembered that you were brothers.¡± 
¡¡¡¡Stannis frowned at her. ¡°You presume too much, Lady Stark. I am the rightful king, and your son no less a traitor than my brother here. His day will come as well.¡± 
¡¡¡¡The naked threat fanned her fury. ¡°You are very free to name others traitor and usurper, my lord, yet how are you any different? You say you alone are the rightful king, yet it seems to me that Robert had two sons. By all the laws of the Seven Kingdoms, Prince Joffrey is his rightful heir, and Tommen after him . . . and we are all traitors, however good our reasons.¡± 
¡¡¡¡Renly laughed. ¡°You must forgive Lady Catelyn, Stannis. She¡¯s come all the way down from Riverrun, a long way ahorse. I fear she never saw your little letter.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Joffrey is not my brother¡¯s seed,¡± Stannis said bluntly. ¡°Nor is Tommen. They are bastards. The girl as well. All three of them abominations born of incest.¡± 
¡¡¡¡Would even Cersei be so mad? Catelyn was speechless. 
¡¡¡¡¡°Isn¡¯t that a sweet story, my lady?¡± Renly asked. ¡°I was camped at Horn Hill when Lord Tarly received his letter, and I must say, it took my breath away.¡± He smiled at his brother. ¡°I had never suspected you were so clever, Stannis. Were it only true, you would indeed be Robert¡¯s heir.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Were it true? Do you name me a liar?¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Can you prove any word of this fable?¡± 
¡¡¡¡Stannis ground his teeth. 
¡¡¡¡Robert could never have known, Catelyn thought, or Cersei would have lost her head in an instant. ¡°Lord Stannis,¡± she asked, ¡°if you knew the queen to be guilty of such monstrous crimes, why did you keep silent?¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°I did not keep silent,¡± Stannis declared. ¡°I brought my suspicions to Jon Arryn.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Rather than your own brother?¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°My brother¡¯s regard for me was never more than dutiful,¡± said Stannis. ¡°From me, such accusations would have seemed peevish and selfserving, a means of placing myself first in the line of succession. I believed Robert would be more disposed to listen if the charges came from Lord Arryn, whom he loved.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Ah,¡± said Renly. ¡°So we have the word of a dead man.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Do you think he died by happenstance, you purblind fool? Cersei had him poisoned, for fear he would reveal her. Lord Jon had been gathering certain proofs¡ª¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°¡ªwhich doubtless died with him. How inconvenient.¡± 
¡¡¡¡Catelyn was remembering, fitting pieces together. ¡°My sister Lysa accused the queen of killing her husband in a letter she sent me at Winterfell,¡± she admitted. ¡°Later, in the Eyrie, she laid the murder at the feet of the queen¡¯s brother Tyrion.¡± 
¡¡¡¡Stannis snorted. ¡°If you step in a nest of snakes, does it matter which one bites you first?¡±
