   Ser Waymar   bravely ¡°Dance   ¡± He lifted  sword high   head defiant His hands trembled   weight       cold Yet   moment Will thought    boy  longer      Night¡¯ Watch
   The Other halted Will saw  eyes blue deeper  bluer   human eyes  blue  burned like ice They fixed   longsword trembling  high watched  moonlight running cold   metal For  heartbeat  dared  hope
