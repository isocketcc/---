¡¡¡¡Slowly, Sansa lowered the knife. Her head seemed terribly light, as if she were floating. This is madness, to trust myself to this drunkard, but if I turn away will the chance ever come again? ¡°How . . . how would you do it? Get me away?¡± 
¡¡¡¡Ser Dontos raised his face to her. ¡°Taking you from the castle, that will be the hardest. Once you¡¯re out, there are ships that would take you home. I¡¯d need to find the coin and make the arrangements, that¡¯s all.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Could we go now?¡± she asked, hardly daring to hope. 
¡¡¡¡¡°This very night? No, my lady, I fear not. First I must find a sure way to get you from the castle when the hour is ripe. It will not be easy, nor quick. They watch me as well.¡± He licked his lips nervously. ¡°Will you put away your blade?¡± 
¡¡¡¡Sansa slipped the knife beneath her cloak. ¡°Rise, ser.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Thank you, sweet lady.¡± Ser Dontos lurched clumsily to his feet, and brushed earth and leaves from his knees. ¡°Your lord father was as true a man as the realm has ever known, but I stood by and let them slay him. I said nothing, did nothing . . . and yet, when Joffrey would have slain me, you spoke up. Lady, I have never been a hero, no Ryam Redwyne or Barristan the Bold. I¡¯ve won no tourneys, no renown in war . . . but I was a knight once, and you have helped me remember what that meant. My life is a poor thing, but it is yours.¡± Ser Dontos placed a hand on the gnarled bole of the heart tree. He was shaking, she saw. ¡°I vow, with your father¡¯s gods as witness, that I shall send you home.¡± 
¡¡¡¡He swore. A solemn oath, before the gods. ¡°Then . . . I will put myself in your hands, ser. But how will I know, when it is time to go? Will you send me another note?¡± 
¡¡¡¡Ser Dontos glanced about anxiously. ¡°The risk is too great. You must come here, to the godswood. As often as you can. This is the safest place. The only safe place. Nowhere else. Not in your chambers nor mine nor on the steps nor in the yard, even if it seems we are alone. The stones have ears in the Red Keep, and only here may we talk freely.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Only here,¡± Sansa said. ¡°I¡¯ll remember.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°And if I should seem cruel or mocking or indifferent when men are watching, forgive me, child. I have a role to play, and you must do the same. One misstep and our heads will adorn the walls as did your father¡¯s.¡± 
¡¡¡¡She nodded. ¡°I understand.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°You will need to be brave and strong . . . and patient, patient above all.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°I will be,¡± she promised, ¡°but . . . please . . . make it as soon as you can. I¡¯m afraid . . .¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°So am I,¡± Ser Dontos said, smiling wanly. ¡°And now you must go, before you are missed.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°You will not come with me?¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Better if we are never seen together.¡± 
¡¡¡¡Nodding, Sansa took a step . . . then spun back, nervous, and softly laid a kiss on his cheek, her eyes closed. ¡°My Florian,¡± she whispered. ¡°The gods heard my prayer.¡± 
¡¡¡¡She flew along the river walk, past the small kitchen, and through the pig yard, her hurried footsteps lost beneath the squealing of the hogs in their pens. Home, she thought, home, he is going to take me home, he¡¯ll keep me safe, my Florian. The songs about Florian and Jonquil were her very favorites. Florian was homely too, though not so old. 
¡¡¡¡She was racing headlong down the serpentine steps when a man lurched out of a hidden doorway. Sansa caromed into him and lost her balance. Iron fingers caught her by the wrist before she could fall, and a deep voice rasped at her. ¡°It¡¯s a long roll down the serpentine, little bird. Want to kill us both?¡± His laughter was rough as a saw on stone. ¡°Maybe you do.¡± 
¡¡¡¡The Hound. ¡°No, my lord, pardons, I¡¯d never.¡± Sansa averted her eyes but it was too late, he¡¯d seen her face. ¡°Please, you¡¯re hurting me.¡± She tried to wriggle free. 
¡¡¡¡¡°And what¡¯s Joff¡¯s little bird doing flying down the serpentine in the black of night?¡± When she did not answer, he shook her. ¡°Where were you?¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°The g-g-godswood, my lord,¡± she said, not daring to lie. ¡°Praying . . . praying for my father, and . . . for the king, praying that he¡¯d not be hurt.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Think I¡¯m so drunk that I¡¯d believe that?¡± He let go his grip on her arm, swaying slightly as he stood, stripes of light and darkness falling across his terrible burnt face. ¡°You look almost a woman . . . face, teats, and you¡¯re taller too, almost . . . ah, you¡¯re still a stupid little bird, aren¡¯t you? Singing all the songs they taught you . . . sing me a song, why don¡¯t you? Go on. Sing to me. Some song about knights and fair maids. You like knights, don¡¯t you?¡± 
¡¡¡¡He was scaring her. ¡°T-true knights, my lord.¡±
