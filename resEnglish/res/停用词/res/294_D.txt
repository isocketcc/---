   Here     Maege Mormont¡¯ warhorn    blast  rolled   valley     tell      Jaime¡¯ riders  entered  trap
   And Grey Wind threw   head  howled
   The sound    right  Catelyn Stark     shivering It   terrible sound  frightening sound    music    For  second  felt  like pity   Lannisters  So    death sounds like  thought
