¡¡¡¡Tyrion remembered a cold night under the stars when he¡¯d stood beside the boy Jon Snow and a great white wolf atop the Wall at the end of the world, gazing out at the trackless dark beyond. He had felt¡ªwhat? something, to be sure, a dread that had cut like that frigid northern wind. A wolf had howled off in the night, and the sound had sent a shiver through him. 
¡¡¡¡Don¡¯t be a fool, he told himself. A wolf, a wind, a dark forest, it meant nothing. And yet . . . He had come to have a liking for old Jeor Mormont during his time at Castle Black. ¡°I trust that the Old Bear survived this attack?¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°He did.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°And that your brothers killed these, ah, dead men?¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°We did.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°You¡¯re certain that they are dead this time?¡± Tyrion asked mildly. When Bronn choked on a snort of laughter, he knew how he must proceed. ¡°Truly truly dead?¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°They were dead the first time,¡± Ser Alliser snapped. ¡°Pale and cold, with black hands and feet. I brought Jared¡¯s hand, torn from his corpse by the bastard¡¯s wolf.¡± 
¡¡¡¡Littlefinger stirred. ¡°And where is this charming token?¡± 
¡¡¡¡Ser Alliser frowned uncomfortably. ¡°it . . . rotted to pieces while I waited, unheard. There¡¯s naught left to show but bones.¡± 
¡¡¡¡Titters echoed through the hall. ¡°Lord Baelish,¡± Tyrion called down to Littlefinger, ¡°buy our brave Ser Alliser a hundred spades to take back to the Wall with him.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Spades?¡± Ser Alliser narrowed his eyes suspiciously. 
¡¡¡¡¡°If you bury your dead, they won¡¯t come walking,¡± Tyrion told him, and the court laughed openly. ¡°Spades will end your troubles, with some strong backs to wield them. Ser Jacelyn, see that the good brother has his pick of the city dungeons.¡± 
¡¡¡¡Ser Jacelyn Bywater said, ¡°As you will, my lord, but the cells are near empty. Yoren took all the likely men.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Arrest some more, then,¡± Tyrion told him. ¡°Or spread the word that there¡¯s bread and turnips on the Wall, and they¡¯ll go of their own accord.¡± The city had too many mouths to feed, and the Night¡¯s Watch a perpetual need of men. At Tyrion¡¯s signal, the herald cried an end, and the hall began to empty. 
¡¡¡¡Ser Alliser Thorne was not so easily dismissed. He was waiting at the foot of the iron Throne when Tyrion descended. ¡°Do you think I sailed all the way from Eastwatch-by-the-Sea to be mocked by the likes of you?¡± he fumed, blocking the way. ¡°This is no jape. I saw it with my own eyes. I tell you, the dead walk.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°You should try to kill them more thoroughly.¡± Tyrion pushed past. Ser Alliser made to grab his sleeve, but Preston Greenfield thrust him back. ¡°No closer, ser.¡± 
¡¡¡¡Thorne knew better than to challenge a knight of the Kingsguard. ¡°You are a fool, Imp,¡± he shouted at Tyrion¡¯s back. 
¡¡¡¡The dwarf turned to face him. ¡°Me? Truly? Then why were they laughing at you, I wonder?¡± He smiled wanly. ¡°You came for men, did you not?¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°The cold winds are rising. The Wall must be held.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°And to hold it you need men, which I¡¯ve given you . . . as you might have noted, if your ears heard anything but insults. Take them, thank me, and begone before I¡¯m forced to take a crab fork to you again. Give my warm regards to Lord Mormont . . . and to Jon Snow as well.¡± Bronn seized Ser Alliser by the elbow and marched him forcefully from the hall. 
¡¡¡¡Grand Maester Pycelle had already scuttled off, but Varys and Littlefinger had watched it all, start to finish. ¡°I grow ever more admiring of you, my lord,¡± confessed the eunuch. ¡°You appease the Stark boy with his father¡¯s bones and strip your sister of her protectors in one swift stroke. You give that black brother the men he seeks, rid the city of some hungry mouths, yet make it all seem mockery so none may say that the dwarf fears snarks and grumkins. Oh, deftly done.¡± 
¡¡¡¡Littlefinger stroked his beard. ¡°Do you truly mean to send away all your guards, Lannister?¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°No, I mean to send away all my sister¡¯s guards.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°The queen will never allow that.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Oh, I think she may. I am her brother, and when you¡¯ve known me longer, you¡¯ll learn that I mean everything I say.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Even the lies?¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Especially the lies. Lord Petyr, I sense that you are unhappy with me.¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°I love you as much as I ever have, my lord. Though I do not relish being played for a fool. If Myrcella weds Trystane Martell, she can scarcely wed Robert Arryn, can she?¡± 
¡¡¡¡¡°Not without causing a great scandal,¡± he admitted. ¡°I regret my little ruse, Lord Petyr, but when we spoke, I could not know the Dornishmen would accept my offer.¡± 
¡¡¡¡Littlefinger was not appeased. ¡°I do not like being lied to, my lord. Leave me out of your next deception.¡±
