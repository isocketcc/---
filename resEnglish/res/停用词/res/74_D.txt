   By   Jon left  armory    midday The sun  broken   clouds He turned      lifted  eyes   Wall blazing blue  crystalline   sunlight Even    weeks  sight    gave   shivers Centuries  windblown dirt  pocked  scoured  covering  like  film      pale grey  color   overcast sky   sun caught  fair   bright day  shone alive  light  colossal bluewhite cliff  filled  half  sky

   When  finally spied Castle Black  timbered keeps  stone towers looked like     handful  toy blocks scattered   snow beneath  vast wall  ice The ancient stronghold   black brothers   Winterfell  true castle   Lacking walls     defended    south    west      north  concerned  Night¡¯ Watch    north loomed  Wall Almost seven  feet high  stood    height   tallest tower   stronghold  sheltered His uncle said    wide    dozen armored knights  ride abreast The gaunt outlines  huge catapults  monstrous wooden cranes stood sentry   like  skeletons  great birds    walked men  black  small  ants
   As  stood outside  armory looking  Jon felt   overwhelmed     day   kingsroad  ¡¯ seen      The Wall  like  Sometimes    forget        forgot   sky   earth underfoot                 world It  older   Seven Kingdoms    stood beneath   looked    Jon dizzy He  feel  great weight    ice pressing          topple   Jon knew    fell  world fell
